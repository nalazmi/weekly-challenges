# Challenge #3 – Physical System Solving Differential Equations

I explored how soap films can act as analog computers that solve Laplace’s Equation. When you dip a wireframe into a soap solution, the film that forms naturally minimizes surface area. This is a physical solution to:

```
∇²ϕ = 0
```

This is a classic example of **intrinsic computation**, where the physics of a system inherently performs the computation without a digital processor. The soap film automatically finds the lowest energy state, which corresponds to the solution of a partial differential equation — no programming needed.

It’s a beautiful and intuitive demonstration of computation beyond silicon!
